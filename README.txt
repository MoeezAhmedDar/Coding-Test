Thoughts on Code Quality
What Makes It Amazing Code:
Well-structured and organized code.
1) Proper use of design patterns.
2) Variables, functions, and classes follow consistent naming conventions.
3) Indentation is consistent.

What Makes It OK Code:
1) Code that functions correctly but might have some minor issues.
2) Adequate commenting but room for improvement.
3) Lacks optimization.

What Makes It Terrible Code:
1) Lack of comments or documentation.
2) Code smells, such as duplicated code or long functions.
3) Lacks proper error handling.

How I Would Have Done It
1) Implement proper error handling mechanisms, including validation of input data and graceful error messages.
2) Use exception handling to catch and handle errors, providing meaningful feedback to users and logging errors for debugging.
3) Break down large functions into smaller, more focused functions that adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle.
4) Identify and eliminate code smells (e.g., duplicated code, long methods, tight coupling).
